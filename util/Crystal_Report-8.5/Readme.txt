are located on the product CD.

The ReleaseNotes.doc file, located in the root directory of the
product CD, includes a comprehensive listing of the known issues and
other important notes that users should be aware of before installing
Crystal Reports 8.5. It is recommended that users read this document
in its entirety before proceeding with their Crystal Reports

The \Docs directory of the Crystal Reports CD contains the Crystal

-----------
Online Help
-----------

Online help is available in two formats: compiled HTML and non-compiled
HTML. We recommend using the compiled version, which is significantly
faster than the non-compiled version.

Compiled HTML help is supported by Internet Explorer 3 and up;
non-compiled HTML help is supported by Netscape Navigator 4.07 and up.
For best results, it is recommended that you use Internet Explorer 5
for compiled HTML help, or Netscape Navigator 4.61 for non-compiled 
HTML help.

Note: Internet Explorer does NOT support non-compiled HTML help.

If you select a Complete or Typical installation, the setup process
installs the online help appropriate to your browser:

* If setup detects IE 3.x or later, then compiled HTML help is
  installed automatically. 
* If setup detects Netscape only, then non-compiled HTML help is
  installed automatically. 
* If setup detects neither browser, then online help is not installed.

Perform a Custom installation if you do not want to install any online
help, or if you want to specify one or both types of online help.

Note: Install your browser BEFORE performing a Custom installation of
the online help. If you first install Crystal Reports, and then 
install your browser, you may experience problems when viewing the
online help. In such cases, you will need to re-install the online
help.
